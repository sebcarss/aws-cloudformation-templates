# CloudFormation Templates

This repository is a place to store all the CloudFormation templates that I create during my exploration of the technology. These are for solely to aid my understanding of CloudFormation so these may not be of use to others and may not even work but please feel free to take what you want from them. 

## Manually Creating the Stack in the AWS Console

  - Go to the AWS Console and log in to your account. 
  - Go to the CloudFormation service. 
  - Choose `Create new stack`
  - Click `Upload a template to Amazon S3`
  - Then `Choose file` and select your YAML file.
  - Click `Next`
  - Type in a Stack Name, e.g. MyAwesomeAWSStack
  - Click `Next` twice.
  - Then `Create`

Your new stack will now be created based on the `Resources` specified in the YAML file.
